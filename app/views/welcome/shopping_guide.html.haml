  %h3 Repairs and Warranty Information
  %p
    All HANCHOR products come with a warranty card (except for certain items that are listed as specialty products in the product descriptions). The warranty card ensures that your HANCHOR product is covered by our repair warranty for the life of the product. We provide free repair services for one year from the date of purchase (starting from the date the product is shipped from our warehouse) for any damage or defect as a result of ordinary product usage. After one year, we will still try our best to provide free repair services, but if the product is severely damaged, we will need to evaluate the repair costs and charge you for the repairs.
    %br
      We sincerely apologize, but we are unable to provide warranty services if:
      %br
        1.You can’t provide the product warranty card.
        %br
          2.The product has been used inappropriately or the product has been damaged as a result of modifying the product.
          %br
            ※Please make sure to keep your warranty card in a safe place as you will need to send it in with your product for repairs under warranty. Because the warranty card tells us important information about each product, we are unable to replace lost cards.
            %br
              ※You will need to pay for all shipping costs for products sent in for repairs.
              %br
                ※We will notify you of the repair time and costs as soon as we receive and evaluate the product.
                %br
  %h3 退換貨規定
  %p
    根據消費者保護法之規定，HANCHOR提供商品到貨七天猶豫期隨時解約退貨之權益，但提醒您注意，商品退貨時必須為全新狀態且完整包裝（ 包含商品、附件、保證卡、內外包裝、隨機文件、贈品等）。若商品為新品瑕疵或商品之情形，煩請將商品在一週內寄回進行退換貨。如回收件姓名與地址有任何更改，請務必迅速通知HANCHOR做資料變更。
  %h3 Return Policy
  %p
    We offer a one month return policy for all international orders. All products must be returned to us in a new and unused condition and returned products must include all accessories and included documentation, the warranty card, all packaging, and any free gifts shipped with the product.
    %br
      ※ We are unable to accept returns of used products or products listed as specialty products on the sales website (because of the unique nature and/or shelf-life limitations of specialty products).
      %br
        ※ You will not be charged for any requests to cancel or exchange your order before we ship it, but you will be responsible for the return shipping charges for any cancellations or exchanges made after we ship your order if the product is determined to be free of any defect.
